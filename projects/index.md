<p align="justify" class="style14">A general activity understanding and event detection system was proposed and evaluated by the Surveillance Event Detection (SED) of TRECVID 2012. A sliding temporal window was employed as the detection unit in our system. We investigated the spatial priors of various events by estimating spatial distributions of activities under different camera views. The explicit feature maps were then applied to approximate large scale non-linear SVMs by linear ones. We further proposed a CascadeSVMs algorithm to deal with highly imbalnaced surveillance data.</p>
