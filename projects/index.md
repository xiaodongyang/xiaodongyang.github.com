<p align="justify">We presented an interactive surveillance event detection system participated in the interactive Surveillance Event Detection (iSED) of TRECVID 2013. We extracted a set of spatio-temporal features and employed Fisher Vector to encode the low-level features. Both feature-level and decision-level fusions were used to combine multiple features. We created two interactive environments: one focusing on high throughput and the other on related result expansion.</p>
