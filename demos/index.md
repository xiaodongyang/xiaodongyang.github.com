## High Throughput iSED

We have human interaction involved in the interactive surveillance event detection process to refine automatic system detections. The high throughput user interface focuses on one event at a time and makes decision for the target event in a minimum amount of time. Following links are the online UIs for the seven events defined by TRECVID.
