## Code

> [SNV](https://github.com/xiaodongyang/SNV) is an open source MATLAB/C++ implementation of the super normal vector for human activity recognition using depth sequences.

> [SSCV](https://github.com/xiaodongyang/SSCV) is an open source MATLAB implementation of the super sparse coding vector for human action recognition.

> [CascadeSVMs](https://github.com/xiaodongyang/CascadeSVMs) is an open source C++ implementation of our proposed CascadeSVMs algorithm to handle highly imbalanced large-scale data learning.

> [ActionHOG](https://github.com/xiaodongyang/ActionHOG) is an open source C++ implementation of an efficient local spatio-temporal feature for human activity analysis.

> [DMM-HOG](/code/dmm-hog) is an open source MATLAB implementation of the depth motion maps feature for human action and hand gesture recognition in depth videos.

## Dataset

> [SynHead](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/dynamic-facial-analysis-bayesian-filtering-recurrent-neural-networks) is a large-scale synthetic dataset for video-based head pose estimation with over 500K frames of 10 head models and 70 motion tracks.
